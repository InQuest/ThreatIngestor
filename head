Usage: nosetests [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -V, --version         Output nose version and exit
  -p, --plugins         Output list of available plugins and exit. Combine
                        with higher verbosity for greater detail
  -v, --verbose         Be more verbose. [NOSE_VERBOSE]
  --verbosity=VERBOSITY
                        Set verbosity; --verbosity=2 is the same as -v
  -q, --quiet           Be less verbose
  -c FILES, --config=FILES
                        Load configuration from config file(s). May be
                        specified multiple times; in that case, all config
                        files will be loaded and combined
  -w WHERE, --where=WHERE
                        Look for tests in this directory. May be specified
                        multiple times. The first directory passed will be
                        used as the working directory, in place of the current
                        working directory, which is the default. Others will
                        be added to the list of tests to execute. [NOSE_WHERE]
  --py3where=PY3WHERE   Look for tests in this directory under Python 3.x.
                        Functions the same as 'where', but only applies if
                        running under Python 3.x or above.  Note that, if
                        present under 3.x, this option completely replaces any
                        directories specified with 'where', so the 'where'
                        option becomes ineffective. [NOSE_PY3WHERE]
  -m REGEX, --match=REGEX, --testmatch=REGEX
                        Files, directories, function names, and class names
                        that match this regular expression are considered
                        tests.  Default: (?:^|[\b_\./-])[Tt]est
                        [NOSE_TESTMATCH]
  --tests=NAMES         Run these tests (comma-separated list). This argument
                        is useful mainly from configuration files; on the
                        command line, just pass the tests to run as additional
                        arguments with no switch.
  -l DEBUG, --debug=DEBUG
                        Activate debug logging for one or more systems.
                        Available debug loggers: nose, nose.importer,
                        nose.inspector, nose.plugins, nose.result and
                        nose.selector. Separate multiple names with a comma.
  --debug-log=FILE      Log debug messages to this file (default: sys.stderr)
  --logging-config=FILE, --log-config=FILE
                        Load logging config from this file -- bypasses all
                        other logging config settings.
  -I REGEX, --ignore-files=REGEX
                        Completely ignore any file that matches this regular
                        expression. Takes precedence over any other settings
                        or plugins. Specifying this option will replace the
                        default setting. Specify this option multiple times to
                        add more regular expressions [NOSE_IGNORE_FILES]
  -e REGEX, --exclude=REGEX
                        Don't run tests that match regular expression
                        [NOSE_EXCLUDE]
  -i REGEX, --include=REGEX
                        This regular expression will be applied to files,
                        directories, function names, and class names for a
                        chance to include additional tests that do not match
                        TESTMATCH.  Specify this option multiple times to add
                        more regular expressions [NOSE_INCLUDE]
  -x, --stop            Stop running tests after the first error or failure
  -P, --no-path-adjustment
                        Don't make any changes to sys.path when loading tests
                        [NOSE_NOPATH]
  --exe                 Look for tests in python modules that are executable.
                        Normal behavior is to exclude executable modules,
                        since they may not be import-safe [NOSE_INCLUDE_EXE]
  --noexe               DO NOT look for tests in python modules that are
                        executable. (The default on the windows platform is to
                        do so.)
  --traverse-namespace  Traverse through all path entries of a namespace
                        package
  --first-package-wins, --first-pkg-wins, --1st-pkg-wins
                        nose's importer will normally evict a package from
                        sys.modules if it sees a package with the same name in
                        a different location. Set this option to disable that
                        behavior.
  --no-byte-compile     Prevent nose from byte-compiling the source into .pyc
                        files while nose is scanning for and running tests.
  -a ATTR, --attr=ATTR  Run only tests that have attributes specified by ATTR
                        [NOSE_ATTR]
  -A EXPR, --eval-attr=EXPR
                        Run only tests for whose attributes the Python
                        expression EXPR evaluates to True [NOSE_EVAL_ATTR]
  -s, --nocapture       Don't capture stdout (any stdout output will be
                        printed immediately) [NOSE_NOCAPTURE]
  --nologcapture        Disable logging capture plugin. Logging configuration
                        will be left intact. [NOSE_NOLOGCAPTURE]
  --logging-format=FORMAT
                        Specify custom format to print statements. Uses the
                        same format as used by standard logging handlers.
                        [NOSE_LOGFORMAT]
  --logging-datefmt=FORMAT
                        Specify custom date/time format to print statements.
                        Uses the same format as used by standard logging
                        handlers. [NOSE_LOGDATEFMT]
  --logging-filter=FILTER
                        Specify which statements to filter in/out. By default,
                        everything is captured. If the output is too verbose,
                        use this option to filter out needless output.
                        Example: filter=foo will capture statements issued
                        ONLY to  foo or foo.what.ever.sub but not foobar or
                        other logger. Specify multiple loggers with comma:
                        filter=foo,bar,baz. If any logger name is prefixed
                        with a minus, eg filter=-foo, it will be excluded
                        rather than included. Default: exclude logging
                        messages from nose itself (-nose). [NOSE_LOGFILTER]
  --logging-clear-handlers
                        Clear all other logging handlers
  --logging-level=LOGCAPTURE_LEVEL
                        Set the log level to capture
  --with-coverage       Enable plugin Coverage:  Activate a coverage report
                        using Ned Batchelder's coverage module.
                        [NOSE_WITH_COVERAGE]
  --cover-package=PACKAGE
                        Restrict coverage output to selected packages
                        [NOSE_COVER_PACKAGE]
  --cover-erase         Erase previously collected coverage statistics before
                        run
  --cover-tests         Include test modules in coverage report
                        [NOSE_COVER_TESTS]
  --cover-min-percentage=COVER_MIN_PERCENTAGE
                        Minimum percentage of coverage for tests to pass
                        [NOSE_COVER_MIN_PERCENTAGE]
  --cover-inclusive     Include all python files under working directory in
                        coverage report.  Useful for discovering holes in test
                        coverage if not all files are imported by the test
                        suite. [NOSE_COVER_INCLUSIVE]
  --cover-html          Produce HTML coverage information
  --cover-html-dir=DIR  Produce HTML coverage information in dir
  --cover-branches      Include branch coverage in coverage report
                        [NOSE_COVER_BRANCHES]
  --cover-xml           Produce XML coverage information
  --cover-xml-file=FILE
                        Produce XML coverage information in file
  --pdb                 Drop into debugger on failures or errors
  --pdb-failures        Drop into debugger on failures
  --pdb-errors          Drop into debugger on errors
  --no-deprecated       Disable special handling of DeprecatedTest exceptions.
  --with-doctest        Enable plugin Doctest:  Activate doctest plugin to
                        find and run doctests in non-test modules.
                        [NOSE_WITH_DOCTEST]
  --doctest-tests       Also look for doctests in test modules. Note that
                        classes, methods and functions should have either
                        doctests or non-doctest tests, not both.
                        [NOSE_DOCTEST_TESTS]
  --doctest-extension=EXT
                        Also look for doctests in files with this extension
                        [NOSE_DOCTEST_EXTENSION]
  --doctest-result-variable=VAR
                        Change the variable name set to the result of the last
                        interpreter command from the default '_'. Can be used
                        to avoid conflicts with the _() function used for text
                        translation. [NOSE_DOCTEST_RESULT_VAR]
  --doctest-fixtures=SUFFIX
                        Find fixtures for a doctest file in module with this
                        name appended to the base name of the doctest file
  --doctest-options=OPTIONS
                        Specify options to pass to doctest. Eg.
                        '+ELLIPSIS,+NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE'
  --with-isolation      Enable plugin IsolationPlugin:  Activate the isolation
                        plugin to isolate changes to external modules to a
                        single test module or package. The isolation plugin
                        resets the contents of sys.modules after each test
                        module or package runs to its state before the test.
                        PLEASE NOTE that this plugin should not be used with
                        the coverage plugin, or in any other case where module
                        reloading may produce undesirable side-effects.
                        [NOSE_WITH_ISOLATION]
  -d, --detailed-errors, --failure-detail
                        Add detail to error output by attempting to evaluate
                        failed asserts [NOSE_DETAILED_ERRORS]
  --no-skip             Disable special handling of SkipTest exceptions.
  --with-id             Enable plugin TestId:  Activate to add a test id (like
                        #1) to each test name output. Activate with --failed
                        to rerun failing tests only.  [NOSE_WITH_ID]
  --id-file=FILE        Store test ids found in test runs in this file.
                        Default is the file .noseids in the working directory.
  --failed              Run the tests that failed in the last test run.
  --processes=NUM       Spread test run among this many processes. Set a
                        number equal to the number of processors or cores in
                        your machine for best results. Pass a negative number
                        to have the number of processes automatically set to
                        the number of cores. Passing 0 means to disable
                        parallel testing. Default is 0 unless NOSE_PROCESSES
                        is set. [NOSE_PROCESSES]
  --process-timeout=SECONDS
                        Set timeout for return of results from each test
                        runner process. Default is 10. [NOSE_PROCESS_TIMEOUT]
  --process-restartworker
                        If set, will restart each worker process once their
                        tests are done, this helps control memory leaks from
                        killing the system. [NOSE_PROCESS_RESTARTWORKER]
  --with-xunit          Enable plugin Xunit: This plugin provides test results
                        in the standard XUnit XML format. [NOSE_WITH_XUNIT]
  --xunit-file=FILE     Path to xml file to store the xunit report in. Default
                        is nosetests.xml in the working directory
                        [NOSE_XUNIT_FILE]
  --xunit-testsuite-name=PACKAGE
                        Name of the testsuite in the xunit xml, generated by
                        plugin. Default test suite name is nosetests.
  --all-modules         Enable plugin AllModules: Collect tests from all
                        python modules.  [NOSE_ALL_MODULES]
  --collect-only        Enable collect-only:  Collect and output test names
                        only, don't run any tests.  [COLLECT_ONLY]
